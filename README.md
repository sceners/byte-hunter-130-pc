│ ■ There is more and more program with frequent updates, that mean that
│   when u cracked 1.1, the 1.2 will be out in few days.. Isn't that some
│   lose of time?
│                  
│   So the idea is, instead bytepatch particular offset, to look for a string
│   and replace it with another..
│   There is not so much sources of progs like this, and most of them are 
│   slow.. really slow (TurboPascal suxx sometimes ;)
│
│ ■ So, we (Nop & THE_q) decided to code one, THE_q do the main work, and i
│   added some improvements, and THE_q finally improved all :)
│
│ ■ U are allowed to use this sourcecode and all components freely, we only
│   ask that u let the "ByteHunter by Nop and THE_q" in the file... 
│
│ ■ It's one of the fastest Search & Replace procedure i ever see, and i 
│   think u will be happy to use it.. so take care of it :)
│
│ ■ I (Nop) want to dedicated this prog to Riz la+ that was looking for one
│   and give me the idea of all this.
